		<h1> Genres </h1>
				<h2 id="jazz">Jazz</h2>
					<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to recognize jazz music with its toe-tapping beat and instrumental solos from the trumpet or saxophone. 
					Jazz has a distinct feel to it and improvisation plays a key part.
					A typical jazz piece will have an instrumental introduction&comma; followed by the main melody of the song. 
				    Following the melody&comma; musicians head into their improvisation or solo sections. 
					This improvisation tends to be one of the great attractions of jazz and what makes it stand out from other music genres. 
					The solos are an opportunity for musicians to play an improvised version of the main theme and show off their skills&comma; often to the delight of the audience&comma; prompting&comma; even encouraging&comma; reactions from those watching.</p>
				<h2 id="hip">Hip-Hop</h2>
					<p>Hip-Hop music is a musical genre consisting of a stylized rhythmic music originally created by DJs isolating the percussion breaks of popular songs&comma; sometimes with two turntables to extend the breaks. 
					Turntablist techniques, such as scratching&comma; beat mixing&sol;matching, and beat juggling eventually developed along with the breaks.
					Hip-Hop music commonly accompanies rapping&comma; a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted.
					Beats, almost always in 4&sol;4 time signature&comma; can be created by sampling and&sol;or sequencing portions of other songs. 
					They also incorporate synthesizers&comma; drum machines, and live bands.
					Rappers may write&comma; memorize&comma; or improvise their lyrics and perform their works a capella or to a percussive beat.</p>
				<h2 id="rock">Rock</h2>
					<p>Rock music is a form of popular music with a prominent vocal melody accompanied by guitar, drums, and bass. 
					Many styles of rock music also use keyboard instruments such as organ&comma; piano&comma; mellotron and synthesizers. 
					It usually has a strong back beat and often revolves around the guitar&comma; either solid electric&comma; hollow electric or acoustic.
					Many rock bands consist of a guitarist&comma; lead singer&comma; bass guitarist and drummer&comma; forming a quartet. 
					Some groups omit one or more of these roles and&sol;or utilize a lead singer who plays an instrument while singing&comma; forming a trio or duo. 
					More rarely&comma; groups also utilize stringed instruments such as violins or cellos and&sol;or horns like trumpets or trombones.</p>
				<h2 id="country">Country</h2>
					<p>Country music was an influence on early rock music&comma; along with blues&comma; jazz and gospel. 
					Many different varieties of country music have arisen over the years&comma; from the slick production of the Nashville sound to the rougher edges of outlaw country. 
					There have been several cycles from periods of experimentation and fusion with other genres giving way to returns to traditionalism and back again.
					Recently&comma; there has been a great deal of crossover between country and pop&comma; beginning with Shania Twain in the mid-1990s and continuing through to Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift. 
					On the other hand&comma; there is also a loosely-defined group of alt-country artists operating outside the mainstream of country and incorporating influences from other genres ranging from folk to punk.
